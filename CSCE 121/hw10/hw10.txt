Problem 1
“Word Scramble”

At first my “random” letters were the same each time; to remedy this I had the user enter a random character to start the game. The random function is used and its output thrown away as many times as the ASCII value of this char before finding the 9 desired letters.

Upon testing next, I realized since my inputs were lowercase, and the given letters were uppercase, they never matched.

————
Enter any character to begin: 3

Letters: X E U O Q Q E K L
Enter a word (enter nothing to quit): leek 	// leek should be available
Word must use the given letters. 0 points awarded. Score: 0

To fix this I first converted my entire input to lowercase, and then compared it to the lowercase version of the letter chars (by subtracting 32 from the ASCII value). This also fixed comparison with the dictionary, which is also in lowercase.

Lastly I played the game several times and tried a variety of inputs to test its hardiness:
I tested that words can’t be repeated, words must be at least 3 letters, words must be in the dictionary, and that they must be made up of the letters provided (using each letter once).
