"Weekday Values"

I entered weekdays followed by ints, "Wed 5 Thurs 4 .". The program worked correctly and summed the values to 9.

I then added invalid strings into the input. "Sat 4 asdf Thurs 4 ." The program rejected the inputs after asdf, as expected, and output 
Sat, 4; 
Rejected entries: 1
Sum of values: 4.
