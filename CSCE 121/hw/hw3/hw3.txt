Problem 1
"Boolean Calculator"

I input varied simple boolean expressions once the program compiled. 1|0 would return true, but 0|1 would return false. 

After debugging, I found and corrected the error. A variable had to take the right-hand operand before an expression or term could evaluate it.

I then tested the individual operators with the following expressions: 1&1; 1&0; 0&0; 1|1; 1|0; 0|0; 1^1; 1^0; 0^0; All outputs were correct.

I next tested order of operations and parentheses with the following inputs and outputs:
1^1&0 = 1
(1^1)&0 = 0

And tested large outputs:
1&0|(0^1)&1;
=1
1&0&1|(1^0|1)&0|1;
=1

Finally I tested bad inputs and received appropriate errors.
1&2&0;
error: Bad token
1&&0;
error: primary expected

Problem 2
"Fibonacci Sequence"

I input 1 2 10 and the program output:
Your sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89;

I input larger numbers and was rewarded:
Enter 1st integer: 235
Enter 2nd integer: 92384
Enter length: 5
Your sequence: 235, 92384, 92619, 185003, 277622;

I input n = 1:
Enter 1st integer: 1
Enter 2nd integer: 2
Enter length: 1
Your sequence: 1, 2;

The program output 2 values though I specified 1. I corrected the error.

I input n = 0;
The correct error message was displayed.

I input a negative integer.
The correct error message was displayed.

Problem 3
Exercise 12
"Smallest, Largest, Mean & Median"
Since there were only 4 values and I was unfamiliar with structs, I preferred to use pointer variables as parameters, rather than return a struct that contained all the values.

I input a simple series to test the output for basic correctness.
Input: 10 9 5 8 7 6 1 3 2 4 0;
Output: Smallest: 0 Largest: 10 Mean: 5 Median: 5

I input only one number to check my algorithm.
Input: 4.65;
Output: Smallest: 4.65 Largest: 4.65 Mean: 4.65 Median: 4.65

I input an odd-length series to test the median with 1 middle value.
Input: 0 3 6;
Output: Smallest: 0 Largest: 6 Mean: 3 Median: 3

I input an even-length series to test the median with 2 middle values.
Input: 6 4 5 2 3 1;
Output: Smallest: 1 Largest: 6 Mean: 3.5 Median: 3.5Â 

I input a more complex series to test the mean and median.
Input: 3 21 4.3 53.4 213.567;
Output: Smallest: 3 Largest: 213.567 Mean: 59.0533 Median: 21

I input only 'x', a non-numerical character to test the program's resilience. The program ended without error, as it should.
