Problem 1
“Linked Lists - Mythological Gods”

At first my program was caught in an infinite loop. I realized the problem was that even though I was calling the “erase()” function on a link to be sorted from the “all_gods” list, and links in that list closed up and no longer pointed towards it, the link itself retained its pointers to the original links. I remedied this by nullifying the link-to-be-sorted’s pointers “pref” and “succ” within the “erase()” function, so that it only retained its “God” member variable when being sorted.

I also created a Link member function “get_first()” that returns the first link in any link’s list; this allows for all links to be printed from first to last, and for the “add_ordered()” function to start at the beginning.

INPUT/OUTPUT

I mixed up the orders in which I added the gods to the ‘all_gods’ list, including:
- adding “Zeus” at the beginning and end
- adding “Ares” at the beginning and end
The list output the gods alphabetically every time.

OUTPUT:
----------------------------------------------------
(1) Adding gods to 'all_gods' using 'add_ordered'...

(2) Printing out all gods using 'print_all'...
