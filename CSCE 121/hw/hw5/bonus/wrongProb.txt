IMPORTANT
I ran my program using the following commands within the specified hw folders (hw5pr1, hw5pr2, etc):

TO COMPILE:
g++-4.7 -std=c++11 *cpp -lfltk -lfltk_images
TO RUN:
./a.out

Problem 1
"Hotel Bookings"

- I input the names of nonexistent hotels, such as "x".
The program correctly output: "There is no hotel named "x". Try again."


- I input a correct hotel name and then entered several invalid date formats to ensure the program did not crash:
input: 1 1 2014 
output: Invalid date format. Try again.
input: 1//1/2014 
output: Invalid date format. Try again.
input: x
output: Invalid date format. Try again.
input: (none)
output: Invalid date format. Try again.


- I continued to input several correctly formatted but invalid dates to check that errors were correctly  handled:
input: 1,0,2014   //There is no day "0":
output: Invalid date. Try again.
input: 1/1/2013   //Won't accept dates in the past: 
output: Invalid date. Try again.
input: 1/2/2015   //Only accepts the year 2014:
output: Invalid date. Try again. 
input: 2/29/2014   //2014 is not a leap year
output: Invalid date. Try again.


- I input an end date that comes before a start date, which I had accounted for:
input:
Enter a valid START date for your 2014 reservation: 1,2,2014
Enter a valid END date for your 2014 reservation: 1,1,2014

output:
End dates must come after start dates. Please try again.


- I incorrectly input an end date on the same day as the start date. (A reservation should be overnight).
input:
Enter a valid START date for your 2014 reservation: 3,2,2014
Enter a valid END date for your 2014 reservation: 3,2,2014

output:
End dates must come after start dates. Please try again.


- I input several valid reservations for the same hotel and dates to fill up the rooms, and then attempted to book further reservations on those dates to test that my program would catch the "Unavailable" exception correctly.
input: 
Enter a valid START date for your 2014 reservation: 1,1,2014
Enter a valid END date for your 2014 reservation: 1,2,2014

output:
No rooms available at Bob's on those dates. Please allow a day between reservations. Try again.


- I input a reservation that spanned a year, with 2 reservations already made for the same 2 days in the middle; even then the rooms should be unavailable:
input: 
Enter a valid START date for your 2014 reservation: 1,1,2014
Enter a valid END date for your 2014 reservation: 12,30,2014
Enter a name for your reservation: d

ouput:
Your reservation "d" has been booked.

This was incorrect, and I discovered and corrected errors in my code so that no rooms were erroneously overbooked.


I input various names for my reservations throughout; all worked correctly, for example: 
input:
Enter a name for your reservation: testing bla $5# ds ;84

output:
Your reservation "testing bla $5# ds ;84" has been booked.

Problem 2
"Superellipse"

I created my own equation/algorithm for displaying a superellipse

_____

I input invalid values for the arguments of the superellipse. To simplify the program, I allowed no negative values.
EXAMPLE 1 :

Enter arguments to define your superellipse.
Please enter at least 2 for 'N' (number of points).
Units for 'a' and 'b' are pixels.
Enter a: 0
Please enter values greater than 0.
Enter a: 1
Enter b: 2
Enter m: -3
Please enter values greater than 0.
Enter m: 2
Enter n: 3
Enter N: .3
Please enter at least 2 for 'N' (number of points).
Enter N: 3  

Drawing lines between points:
(0, 2)
(0.666667, -1.64414)
(-0.666667, 1.64414)
Drawing shape...

Number of lines: 3

_____

I tested the superellipse with various parameters:
EXAMPLE 2:

Enter arguments to define your superellipse.
Please enter at least 2 for 'N' (number of points).
Units for 'a' and 'b' are pixels.
Enter a: 100
Enter b: 100
Enter m: 1
Enter n: 1
Enter N: 10

Drawing lines between points:
(0, 100)
(40, -60)
(80, 20)
(80, -20)
(40, 60)
(0, -100)
(-40, 60)
(-80, -20)
(-80, 20)
(-40, -60)
Drawing shape...

Number of lines: 45

_____

I input an 'N' of the minimum, 3. While the superellipse does not look "equal", this is due to my definition of equal in the program, using my own algorithm: Points alternate on either end of the x-axis equally, and are spaced equally apart. They still lie upon the graph for the equation of the superellipse as dictated.
EXAMPLE 3:
(see screenshot2.png)

I input various viable values for the superellipse. The program did not crash and always displayed a star shape
EXAMPLESâ€¦
(see screenshot1.png)

Problem 3
Chapter 13 Exercise 10
"Polygon"

I input bad values to ensure the program would not crash.
Inputs and Outputs: 
Enter the center x-coordinate: -1
Input values must be positive.
Enter the center x-coordinate: 2
Enter the center y-coordinate: 2
Enter the number of sides: 1
Number of sides must be greater than 2.
Enter the number of sides: 2
Number of sides must be greater than 2.
Enter the number of sides: -3.4
Number of sides must be greater than 2.
Enter the number of sides: 5
Enter the distance from center to corner: 0
Input values must be positive.
Enter the distance from center to corner: 1

I input values for a very small polygon and received a doable exception:
Enter the distance from center to corner: 1
Exception: two polygon points lie in a straight line

I input various polygon characteristics to test the program and enjoy my success:
(see screenshot1.png and screenshot2.png)

**Example**
Enter the center x-coordinate: 100
Enter the center y-coordinate: 100
Enter the number of sides: 17
Enter the distance from center to corner: 134.8

Drawing polygon...

Polygon drawn successfully.

** Example**
Enter the center x-coordinate: 100
Enter the center y-coordinate: 100
Enter the number of sides: 18
Enter the distance from center to corner: 80

Drawing polygon...

Polygon drawn successfully.
