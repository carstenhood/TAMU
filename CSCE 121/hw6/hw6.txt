Problem 1
"Bibliography"

I input bad file names to make sure the program would not crash.

>>
File name: bla
Loading file...
Could not open file. Try again.
<<

I put default text into the "read" file. The output file converted it perfectly to the example.

>>
File opened successfully.
Writing to file...

Bibliography formatted successfully. Program terminating.
<<

I used bad input files to test that the program would terminate gracefully.

An empty file:
>>
File opened successfully.
Reading file...

No raw data detected. File may be empty or already formatted. Program Terminating.
<<

A file already formatted:
>>
File opened successfully.
Reading file...

No raw data detected. File may be empty or already formatted. Program Terminating.
<<

A messy file:
>>
File opened successfully.
Reading file...

No raw data detected. File may be empty or already formatted. Program Terminating.
<<

A file with some data missing: The program ran fine and output as if nothing was wrong: However, some data was inserted incorrectly, and missing data was left out of the finished bibliography. I added a new error class "Bad_data", but if the data is bad, there is not much I can do except terminate the program gracefully. 

>>
File opened successfully.
Reading file...
Read in a book.

Error reading file. Program terminating.

Problem 2
Exercise 11 of Chapter 14 
"Binary Tree"

I compiled with the command: 
g++-4.7 -std=c++11 *cpp -lfltk -lfltk_images

I ran with the command:
./a.out

I first test the program with levels==40; it proved to be so slow that I had to restart my terminal;

I created limits; the user can input values such that 0 <= levels <=20 (after 20 the program is extremely slow.)

I input bad values to test that they were caught:
>>
Enter number of levels for your binary tree: -1
Number of levels must be at least 0 and no more than 20.
Enter number of levels for your binary tree: 21
Number of levels must be at least 0 and no more than 20.
<<

I input non-integers:
>>
Enter number of levels for your binary tree: asd
Invalid input. Try again.
Enter number of levels for your binary tree:  //nothing
Invalid input. Try again.
<<

I input appropriate values:
>>
Enter number of levels for your binary tree: 3

Drawing binary tree...

Binary tree drawn successfully.
<<

I input "0" to ensure that no nodes were shown, and "1" to ensure that only 1 node was shown.

I input several larger values. 
>>
Enter number of levels for your binary tree: 16

Drawing binary tree...

Binary tree drawn successfully.
