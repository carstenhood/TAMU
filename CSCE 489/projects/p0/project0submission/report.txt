Project 0 Report
• I spent 7-10 hours on this project (starting was very slow).
• This was my first time ever to use Python.
• To build/run simply execute aggiestack.py: $ python aggiestack.py
• The program is meant to accept multiple commands in a single run and isn’t persistent.
• All commands are logged in aggiestack-log.txt, which saves when the program closes.
• Since the assignment didn’t specify this, syntax errors in any text file line simply disqualify the line and are noted to the user but processing continues; also, inputting multiple files for the same data class (e.g., multiple hardware config text files) is cumulative and appends the new items to the list.

Valid command examples (can prepend “aggiestack” to any of them):
config --hardware hdwr-config.txt
config --images image-config.txt
config --flavors flavor-config.txt
show hardware
show images
show flavors
show all
admin show hardware
admin can_host k1 small
quit
exit
