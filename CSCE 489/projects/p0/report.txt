Project 0 Report / Instructions

• I spent 7-10 hours on this project (starting was very slow).
• This was my first time ever to use Python.
• To build/run simply execute aggiestack.py: $ python aggiestack.py
• The program is meant to accept multiple commands in a single run and isn’t persistent.
• All commands are logged in aggiestack-log.txt, which saves when the program closes.

valid command examples (can prepend “aggiestack” to any of them):
config --hardware hdwr-config.txt
config --images image-config.txt
config --flavors flavor-config.txt
show hardware
show images
show flavors
show all
admin show hardware
admin can_host k1 small
quit
exit
