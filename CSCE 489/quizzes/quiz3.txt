You can consult anything in the Internet but do not consult your classmates or friends.

We do not expect perfect answers. In some cases, we are interested in seeing how you approach the question.

QUESTION 1 (15 pts)
What is IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS?

--------
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are the three main types of cloud computing services.
• IaaS stands for "Infrastructure as a Service": in IaaS a provider offers hardware infrastructure for computing purposes online, along with basic management software. IaaS provides a means of renting server hardware from a third party.
• PaaS stands for "Platform as a Service": cloud services in this category generally supply an online platform and environment for users to create and manage custom applications.
• SaaS stands for "Software as a Service": SaaS providers host software online and license it to subscribers; SaaS is essentially a means of providing and controlling access to software online from a centralized source.

QUESTION 2 (15 pts)
How do cloud storage services enable big data analytics?

--------
Cloud storage provides the flexibility, robustness, and storage volume necessary to maintain and manage large data sets. Big data analytics often involves varying or expanding volumes of data, which are more easily stored in cloud storage than in less scalable local data centers. Cloud storage typically guarantees more accessibility and resiliency to loss than local storage. Using cloud storage also facilitates big data analytic processes through software such as Hadoop and MapReduce.

QUESTION 3 (15 pts)
How are GFS/HDFS file systems differerent from usual file systems?

--------
GFS/HDFS differs from conventional file systems in several ways. GFS/HDFS distribute files across multiple nodes or machines. Once written, files are not modified but only read. GFS/HDFS also provides fault tolerance, so that the file system is maintained during machine failures. This is a fundamental difference from traditional file systems, which provide no similar safety mechanism.

QUESTION 4 (10 pts)
Explain the Map Reduce programming paradigm with an example.

--------
To illustrate MapReduce we'll walk through the WordCount task of counting the instances of each word in a text file.
• First is the mapping step. For WordCount, we pass the text file's individual words in the form of a list to the mapper, which converts this list of words to an equally-sized list of key-value pairs, each instance of each word being a key with an accompanying value of 1.
• Second is the grouping and sort-and-shuffle step. Each key-value pair is grouped according to its key: so each unique word serves as the key for an associated list of 1s whose size represents the number of instances of the associated word.
• Next is the reduce phase. Each word's list is summed up so that each word is associated with a total instance count for that word instead of a list of 1s; the final result is the desired list of words and their instance counts.

QUESTION 5 (45 pts)
Storage options: Consider the following cloud storage solutions:

Amazon Glacier is a service used to back up or archive data. Storage costs are extremely low ($0.004 per GB per month). You also pay to retrieve the data, where it costs lesser if you can afford to wait. For instance, you pay 0.03 per GB to retrieve data in 1-2 hours, whereas you pay $0.0025 per GB if you can wait 5-12 hours).

Amazon S3 is an object store where you pay per GB per month of storage (e.g., $0.023 per GB per month up to 50TB), for requests on the data, for maintenance, to transfer data to and from S3. The cost to read data is significantly lower than the cost to write.

DropBox is a cloud storage service that costs per TB per month ($12.5 per user per month up to 2TB for 3 users). You don’t pay to retrieve data or move it around. You can locally synchronize files in your devices.  
// $.0125 GB

For each of the following applications, answer the question: Would you need to use any of the above storage services this application? If so, how would you use them? If not, what do you suggest instead. (15 points each)

1. You want to write an application for image search for flowers. You have around 70GB of images. You may upload more images when necessary. The user base you expect are researchers from across the globe. 
--------
1. We could use Amazon S3 to host our images. S3 would host a searchable database comprising primarily of the image files. The cost of storage and image upload and retrieval would be very cheap, only a few dollars a month. The images would be immediately accessible online from anywhere in the world.
---------

2. Consider a small team of researchers working on fairly independent parts of a project. They are expected to go to forests with limited connectivity to the Internet for extended periods of time for their experiments. They want to share all their research files with each other and collaborate when they need to write papers.
--------
2. The researchers could use individual or collective DropBox or Google Drive accounts. For example, they could create a collaborative DropBox account or a team Google Drive directory where they could upload, organize, and view all their files. Files could be downloaded locally for offline use. Depending on the scale of the project and its files this service may be free and we can ignore DropBox's payment formula.
---------

3. Your research group has an enormous collection of data from past projects that includes images and videos of experiments. You have moved to a slightly different area of research, so you do not have immediate use for that data, but you may need this data in the future.
--------
3. For a truly enormous data set that may serve some future use, Amazon Glacier appears suitable. The data can be uploaded and stored on the Amazon Glacier service for a low monthly rate. The retrieval fee can be paid at a later date if we choose to access the data down the road. This is likely one of the safest options for preserving the data cheaply.
