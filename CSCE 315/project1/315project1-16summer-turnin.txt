NOTE:  Please follow your lab instructor's directions for submitting
your assignment through CSNET.  ONLY ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED TO CSNET WILL
BE GRADED!  Make a printout of each source file and staple it behind
this cover sheet, unless your lab instructor directs otherwise.  Sign it
and give it to your TA in lab or put it in your TA's mailbox in the
corner of the 3rd floor of HRBB, near room 312.  IF YOU DO NOT TURN IN A
SIGNED COVER SHEET YOUR WORK WILL NOT BE GRADED!

NOTE:  Homework will be graded on build.tamu.edu using "g++ -std=c++17
-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -fsanitize=address,undefined" and should produce no
warnings or errors during compilation, linking, or execution.
You are free to develop your programs on Visual C++ or any other platform, 
but it is your responsibility to make sure your programs also compile, link,
and execute correctly on build.cse.tamu.edu using the g++ command above.

NOTE:  Each file submitted (project1.cpp, etc.--see below) must begin as 
follows:
//Your Name
//CSCE 315-100
//Due: June 6, 2016 (or whatever the due date is)
//project1.cpp (or whatever this file name is)

The grade for this project will be based on style (formatting, variable
names, comments, etc.), syntax (no compilation or link errors), and
correctness (no runtime errors, passes all test cases).  Follow the style 
guide at http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/PPP-style-rev3.pdf, 
with the following changes:
1.  No more than one statement per line.
2.  No function longer than 24 lines (one terminal window).
3.  No line longer than 80 characters.

Your grade for this project is:

Style           /50
Syntax          /25
Correctness     /25
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Total           /100





















This is an individual project in C++ to write your own sqrt without using:
	1. any form of division (/, %, functionals, ASM instructions, 
	   writing your own divide or reciprocal function, etc.) or
	2. any math functions (sqrt, log, log10, exp, pow, ASM instructions, 
	   etc.)
except that you may use sqrt in a default check function (which will not be
graded) and you may use pow(double, int) but not the other pow functions.

Your function should be named my_sqrt and be the same as sqrt except that you
do not need to check for a negative argument and you do not need to set errno.

Your function should be:
	1. as accurate as possible (different from the library sqrt by no more 
		than 1 in the last bit of the mantissa),
	2. fast, and
	3. simple.

Submit to CSNET a file named project1.cpp containing the code below with your
code inserted as noted.  To grade your program another check function will be 
substituted.

//Your Name

using namespace std;

void __attribute__((weak)) check(double alt_sqrt(double));

//default check function - definition may be changed - will not be graded
void __attribute__((weak)) check(double alt_sqrt(double)){
	if(alt_sqrt(123456789.0) == sqrt(123456789.0))cout << "PASS\n";
	else cout << "FAIL\n";
	return;
}

//change this definition -  will be graded by a different check function
double my_sqrt(double x){
	return 0.0;	//stub ***********************************************
}

//Do not change this function
int main(){
	check(my_sqrt); 
	return 0;
}
