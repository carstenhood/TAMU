I tested my program 5 times, once for every operator and again with an invalid operator "x". I chose to input the values 2 and 3 as the operands, to keep the math simple but still demonstrate that the program functions correctly.

Output 1
Operation: +
First operand: 2
Second operand: 3
Output: 5

Output 2
Operation: -
First operand: 2
Second operand: 3
Output: -1

Output 3
Operation: *
First operand: 2
Second operand: 3
Output: 6

Output 4
Operation: /
First operand: 2
Second operand: 3
Output: 0.666667

Output 5
Operation: x
First operand: 2
Second operand: 3
Invalid Operator
