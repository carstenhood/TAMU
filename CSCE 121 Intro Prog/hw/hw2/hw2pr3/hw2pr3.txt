"Quadratic Formula"

I input all positive values, a = 4; b = 6; c = 8; The program terminated gracefully, as there were no real roots.

I input 0s to see if the formula worked. I realized I couldn't allow 'a' to be 0, because that would make a denominator 0. I corrected it and tested a = 0; the code returned the appropriate error.

To test other vars equaling 0, I input a = -6; b = 0; c = 6; The code functioned correctly and output:
Root 1 = 12; Root 2 = -12
x1 = -1; x2 = 1

I tested the code several again with various large, random doubles. It functioned to produce two roots and two answers.

Output:
a = 4894.242
b = 29374.9
c = -245245.9
Root 1 = 75259.9
Root 2 = -75259.9
x1 = 4.68765
x2 = -10.6896
