"Names and Scores"

I tested my program with correct inputs twice. I entered common names and basic integers to ensure that the program functions correctly when the user inputs are valid. I then tested the program twice with a repeated name, and received the appropriate error message. I also entered to random strings, and received no entries, as expected.

Output 1: (correct entries)
Enter name and score pairs:
John 2
Dave 2342
Sarah 23
No more

Entries:
(John,2)
(Dave,2342)
(Sarah,23)


Output 2: (correct entries)
Enter name and score pairs:
John 23
Bob -2532
No more

Entries:
(John,23)
(Bob,-2532)


Output 3: (repeated entries)
Enter name and score pairs:
Dave 2
John 3
Dave 7
Error. Repeated Entry.


Output 4: (repeated entries)
Enter name and score pairs:
